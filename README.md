# Concept
Nothing really, I just felt like making such things at some point. It's fun and I could learn a lot as I go so all good.<br>
The game's name was a joke ongoing between my friend's group, it's funny so I won't change it.

# Gameplay
It's a turn-based strategy game, something something. The base mechanic is kept as simple as possible, so I can frontload all the more complex things into the enemies and maybe even your own characters.<br>
The game's base flow: 
<ol>
  <li>You choose which enemies to fight</li>
  <li>You choose which characters to use</li> 
  <li>Some optional mysterious thingy ðŸ‘€</li>
  <li>You fight them.</li>
</ol>

Other stuff, you will gradually figure out as you play.
